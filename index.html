    <p>The Realistic Open-World Experience Showdown</p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <section>
      <p>
        The world of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_simulation_game" target="_blank">car simulation games</a> has evolved rapidly in recent years. 
        Two titles leading the genre are <strong>Car Simulator 2</strong> and <strong>Car Parking Multiplayer</strong>. 
        Both bring realistic driving experiences, diverse car collections, and social multiplayer elements, but they approach realism in unique ways. 
        This article breaks down the differences, features, and community perspectives that shape these two fan-favorite driving sims.
      </p>
    </section>

    <h2>Gameplay Overview</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Car Simulator 2</strong> emphasizes an immersive open-world environment with missions, races, and city driving. Players can purchase new cars, 
      participate in police chases, and freely explore environments that mimic real-life driving conditions. 
      <strong>Car Parking Multiplayer</strong>, meanwhile, focuses more heavily on accurate parking physics, 
      real-time multiplayer sessions, and interactive player communities where users trade vehicles, chat, and even roleplay urban life.

      The realism of both games sets them apart from casual racing titles. Car Simulator 2 gives a broad sense of speed and city navigation,
      allowing players to experience daily driving with authentic sounds and interior views. 
      Car Parking Multiplayer, however, refines the micro-level of control — where steering precision and parking angles determine success.

    </p>

    <h2>Community & Multiplayer Features</h2>
    <p>
      Multiplayer gameplay is the heart of both titles. In <strong>Car Parking Multiplayer</strong>, players interact through virtual car meets, exchanges, and
      cooperative missions. Many enthusiasts share custom driving sessions and maps hosted on community platforms like 
      <a href="https://cpmworld.bitbucket.io/" target="_blank">CPM World</a>, which showcase innovative community builds and events.  
      Meanwhile, Car Simulator 2 players enjoy missions with friends, races, and competitive leaderboards that test their street driving and teamwork.
    </p>

    <h2>Visuals and Performance</h2>

      Both games deliver solid mobile graphics. Car Simulator 2 provides dynamic environments and more varied terrain, while Car Parking Multiplayer 
      excels in car detailing and urban lighting. Players often prefer <a href="https://carparkingmultiplayer.atwebpages.com/" target="_blank">community servers</a> 
      to experience customized worlds, adding a personal touch to the standard gameplay loop. Performance is smooth on mid-range devices,
